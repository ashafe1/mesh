# mesh
Mesh generation including deformation functions and linear solvers.

Tools have been devloped to allow the construction of a 2d or 3d mesh. Functions have been written to stretch the mesh via the displacement of nodes.
This gives rise to a system of residual equations, where the neccesary tools are given to find their solution.
